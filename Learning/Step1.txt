1️⃣ What You Have Built So Far (In Simple Words)

Think of your backend like a SaaS product skeleton.
Right now, you’ve built the database brain of the system.

🔹 Overall Picture

You created:

A Python backend project

Connected it to PostgreSQL

Defined all tables using Python code

Automatically created those tables using migrations

👉 This is the same as:

“I finished all my @Entity classes and database schema in Spring Boot.”

2️⃣ What Each Part Does (Plain English)
🧠 FastAPI + SQLAlchemy

FastAPI = handles HTTP requests (like Spring MVC)

SQLAlchemy = talks to PostgreSQL (like Hibernate/JPA)

Alembic = version control for DB (like Flyway)

So now:

Python code → ORM → PostgreSQL
You never write raw SQL manually (unless needed).

👤 users table

This stores who is using your system.

Each user has:

Email

Password (stored safely as hash)

Name, company

Status (active / suspended)

🟢 Without this table → no login, no ownership, no security.

📦 subscription_plans table

This defines what you sell.

Examples:

Basic

Professional

Enterprise

Each plan defines:

Price

Monthly/yearly

File size limit

API usage limit

Features (stored flexibly)

🟢 This table is created by admin, not users.

🔁 subscriptions table

This connects:

User → Plan

It answers:

Which plan is the user on?

Is it trial, active, expired?

When does it start/end?

🟢 This is the heart of your SaaS billing logic.

🔑 api_keys table

This is how external clients access your API.

Instead of username/password:

They send an API key

You verify it

You check usage & subscription

Important:

You never store the real key

Only a hashed version (like passwords)

🟢 This enables secure API usage.

📊 usage_tracking table

This is your control & analytics table.

It tracks:

Which API was called

By whom

How long it took

File size

Success/failure

🟢 Used for:

Rate limiting

Billing

Dashboards

Abuse detection

💳 payment_transactions table

This records money-related events.

It answers:

How much was paid

Through which gateway

Was it successful or refunded?

🟢 Critical for audits and finance.

📁 analysis_history table

This records what analysis was done.

It links:

User

API key

Subscription

Uploaded file

🟢 Useful for:

User history

Support

Debugging
