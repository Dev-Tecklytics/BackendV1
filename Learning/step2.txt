Now we move into Phase 2: User Registration & Login (Authentication).
I’ll go slow, structured, and practical, exactly how a senior would onboard a junior.

In this message I’ll:

Explain how auth will work (simple words, Spring Boot analogy)

Show what we will build

Then start with actual code: User Registration

1️⃣ How Authentication Will Work (Simple Words)
Big picture

We will use JWT (JSON Web Token).

Flow:

User registers → password is hashed → saved in DB
User logs in → password verified → JWT token generated
User calls APIs → sends JWT → backend validates → allows access

Spring Boot comparison
Spring Boot	FastAPI
Spring Security	FastAPI Dependencies
PasswordEncoder	passlib (bcrypt)
OncePerRequestFilter	Dependency / Middleware
JWT Utils	python-jose
2️⃣ What We Will Build (Step-by-Step)

We will NOT rush.

Step A (now)

User Registration API

Password hashing

Save user in DB

Step B

Login API

Password verification

JWT generation

Step C

JWT validation

Protect routes

3️⃣ New Concepts You’ll Learn (Important)

Don’t skip this mentally.

🔐 Password Hashing

We never store plain passwords

We store a bcrypt hash

Same as Spring’s BCryptPasswordEncoder

🧾 Schemas (DTOs)

FastAPI separates:

Request/Response models (Pydantic)

DB models (SQLAlchemy)

Think:

@RequestBody DTO vs @Entity

-------------------------------------------------------------

Now we implement Login + JWT, the most important backend concept.
I’ll explain why, how, and then code, always mapping to Spring Boot so it’s easy.

Take this slow and read line-by-line.

1️⃣ What Login Actually Means (Simple Words)

Login does 3 things:

Verify email exists

Verify password is correct

Issue a JWT token (like a session)

After login:

Client sends JWT on every request

Backend trusts the JWT

No DB lookup needed every time

2️⃣ JWT Explained (Spring Analogy)
JWT = Signed Identity Card

It contains:

Who the user is

When token expires

Signed by server secret

Spring Boot equivalent
UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter
→ JWT token
→ SecurityContext

FastAPI equivalent
Login API
→ create JWT
→ Dependency validates JWT
